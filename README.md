# DecoratorProject4
Decorator pattern implementation for COMP 373

- To run the project, clone it locally and run the view package to see output
- The point of this project was to see how to implement a decorator in a vehicle system. Here we have 3 concrete classes which implement the vehicle interface. To add a paint color to the vehicle we use a decorator which takes in the argument from the vehicle interface and overrides it to add a new function which is defined in concrete class of the decorator, in this case it paints the vehicle red.
